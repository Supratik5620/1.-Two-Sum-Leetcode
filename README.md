# LeetCode Solutions Repository
Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various coding questions from the LeetCode platform.

## About LeetCode
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular online platform that provides a collection of coding challenges to help you prepare for technical interviews. It covers a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and system design.

## Repository Structure
In this repository, you will find my solutions organized by question number. Each solution is implemented in a specific programming language and accompanied by a detailed explanation of the approach used. The code is well-documented and follows best practices to ensure readability and clarity.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the solutions in this repository to learn and understand different approaches to solving coding problems. You can browse the code, read the explanations, and even use them as a reference for your own solutions. However, I encourage you to solve the problems on your own before referring to the solutions here.

## Contribution
While this repository primarily serves as a showcase of my own solutions, I welcome contributions from the community. If you have an alternative approach or an improvement to an existing solution, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and follows the existing code style.

## Disclaimer
It's important to note that LeetCode discourages sharing exact solutions to ongoing contests or publicizing the contents of those contests. Therefore, this repository does not contain solutions from any active contests. All the solutions provided here are from previously published LeetCode questions.

## Contact
